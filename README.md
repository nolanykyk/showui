# CUSTOM UI UPDATER

This script allows you to use an image (or multiple) and have a value over that image be updated every tenth of a second (you can make this whatever). 
This is a very easy script, and the reason I posted it was to allow people just to copy this on their maps instead of using a hud device to display values on the screen (very ugly imo)
